Before using the testbench, please change the parameters top of the main function. 

If everything is implemented please use address_increment_only_tb.cpp. It increments address by 4.

In manual_instruction_tb.cpp, the testbench manually sets instruction, which requires verilog to have an input of instr. It assumes the non-existance of Instr Mem. You should use this ONLY if there is neither instructions nor Instr Mem.
